# Spectral Shrine Macro
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/DaRealFreak/bns-project-eva)  
Macro to farm the dungeon "Spectral Shrine" on easy and normal mode automatically. While essentially still being a macro with just some color checks this can possibly get you banned though. Usage is therefore obviously on your own risk.

## Installation
You'll have to configure quite a few parts of this repository to get this macro to work with your ClientConfiguration.xml and settings.
But for the installation itself you only need [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) installation.  
Execute the `main.ahk` for the main functionality. If your Blade & Soul is running as administrator you'll have to execute the `main.ahk` also as administrator. Else the script doesn't require administrator rights.

## Configuration

### [config.ahk](config.ahk):
Here you can configure hotkeys for your macro. This includes hotkeys for the repair tools and buff food.  
I can't help with what hotkeys you want to use, just read the functions and decide yourself.

### [ui.ahk](ui.ahk):
The most important file to configure. This class contains pixel positions and color codes which are depending on your resolution and ClientConfiguration.xml.
Basically read the function name and the doc block to see what position you have to check with `F1`. `F1` will insert the relevant code at your current mouse position into your clipboard and you can just paste it.  
Only exceptions are the functions `ClickEasyMode`, `ClickNormalMode`, `MoveMouseOverMap` and `ClickWindstridePoint`.
The ClickEasyMode and ClickNormalMode function require the x and y coordinates of your the easy and normal mode options on entering eva. You can copy those also from the code generated by the `F1` functionality. MoveMouseOverMap and ClickWindstringPoint require your map positions (first zoom in after fully zooming out) of the windstride point close to eva.  

### [class.ahk](class.ahk)
Here you can simply include the class you want to play. If the class is not implemented yet feel free to create the configuration for your class and create a pull request.
This basically is a simple spam macro help and to manage stances of your class if needed.

### [hotkeys.ahk](hotkey.ahk)
If you want to change the macro hotkeys for the functionality you're free to do here.

## Usage
The default hotkeys for the macro are:
| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| F1 | Color Check at current mouse position |
| Numpad 0 | Start the farm macro |
| Numpad Delete | Reload the farm macro |
| Numpad Enter | Fully close the farm macro |

As mentioned above you can change those hotkeys in the [hotkeys.ahk](hotkeys.ahk)
